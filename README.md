# NUS-cheatsheet

## About
This repo contains a list of all the past modules I have taken in NUS which were closed-book, and allowed a piece of double-sided A4 size Cheatsheet.

Here I have uploaded the Cheatsheet I used for the Final Examinations in hope that someone would benefit from them, since I no longer have a use for these Cheatsheets.

The CS2030 folder contains teaching materials I used when I was a Teaching Assistant for the module. There is no cheatsheet for this module since it was open-book when I took it.

Do not be alarm if some parts of the cheatsheet make no sense - they probably are meant for myself to understand only.

## Usage
In general, you are free to download, modify, or print the cheatsheets out for your own usage or for actual Examination usage. You are free to distribute them whether in original format or after modifications.

As module content are constantly undergoing changes each semester, some of the content in the Cheatsheets might be obsolete or incomplete. Hence, you agree to use them at your own risk. There might be typos or incorrect information given in the cheatsheets, and you shall read them at your own discretion and I shall bear no liability to any miscommunications or harm you might get from reading these cheatsheets. Don't blame me if you score poorly using these cheatsheets :)

## Recommendation
It is recommended for you to create your own cheatsheet since you are more aware of what information you need to refer to in the actual examination. In addition, the process of making the cheatsheet helps enforce learning. Therefore, it is more appropriate to use the cheatsheets here as revision materials to close any learning gaps that you might have.

## Credits
Majority of the content in the cheatsheets were the results of lecture notes given by the respective professors. Hence, those materials were not created by me - I merely copied and consolidated different important segments in the lecture notes into a double-sided A4 size cheatsheet.
