### ST2137 Computer Aided Data Analysis
Taken in Covid-Sem, where exam is fully online and open book.

This cheatsheet allows one to find out quickly what is the corresponding code for doing something. For example, to find out the Python / R / SAS code for drawing Scatter Plot, simply search for `Scatter Plot`, and change the variables such as PathName and Labels.

Since this Module was taught in R + Python + SAS, there are codes in all 3 languages to each headings.

### Semester taken
2020 Aug-Dec under Prof. Daisy

### Grade obtained
A

### Note
Though I believe most codes are written correctly as I wrote all and tested them personally, there may still be typo. Use it at your own discretion.
