## About
I was a Teaching Assistant (TA) for CS2030 in 2018 August-Dec and 2019 Jan-May.

These are the teaching slides I used for the batch 2019 Jan-May during tutorial lessons.

The tutorial questions were set by Dr. Henry Chia and Prof. Ooi Wei Tsang. The slides were created by me, adding in more depth to the answers, as well as additional tips and tricks embedded in the slides.

Feel free to use these slides as revision materials. You can drop me a message if you are interested in the Powerpoint version. I uploaded the PDF version for ease of reading.

Note that Week 4 was a public holiday, hence no tutorial lesson for Week 4.
